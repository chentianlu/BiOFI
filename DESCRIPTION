Description: It is a strategy that provides the identification of metabolome and microbiome (Bi-omics) feature. 
            It is able to screen out key/driving features (metabolites, microbes, and pathway functions) by an integrated 
            importance score (IIS),combining sub-scores derived from difference, correlation, abundance, and network analysis. 
            It is able to identify microbe-function-metabolite chains and to rank association pairs within specific functions.
